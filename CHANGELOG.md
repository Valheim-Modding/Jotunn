* Fixed mocks targeting an asset starting with an underscore were not split correctly and threw exceptions

## Version 2.14.6
* Added a soft dependency to the LocalizationCache mod so that it loads a bit earlier. This has no direct impact on Jötunn
* Changed prebuild references from the unstripped_corlib folder to the game assemblies as Valheim is no longer unstripped and the folder has been removed from the BepInEx package
* Fixed the debug mode Jötunn ASCII art
* Fixed AddComponentCopy was setting the name and tag of the Component's GameObject
* Fixed KeyHints for left hand items

## Version 2.14.5
* Fixed GUIManager assets not being properly initialized when later accessed, causing some elements to not show up
* Fixed an edge case where holding a reference to the ObjectDB causes it not to be destroyed correctly. This fixes some errors on logout with certain mods

* Removed the console clear command to improve mod compatibility. With the recent changes, the command wasn't always added anyway

## Version 2.14.1

## Version 2.14.0
* Fixed the SynchronizationManager wasn't always initialised, resulting in no sync of admin configs

## Version 2.13.0
* Improved startup time by only initialising accessed managers. This reduces the load time without dependent mods by about 90% (on my machine under 100ms instead of 800ms), making Jötunn almost unnoticeable. When all managers are accessed, the overall startup time is the same as before. Also, if a Valheim update breaks some parts, only loaded managers are affected
* Added `AssetUtils.LoadTextFromResources` overload without assembly parameter
* Added CustomCreature constructor with AssetBundle parameter
* Added `ZoneManager.CreateLocationContainer` with AssetBundle parameter
* Added `CustomVegetation.IsValid` interface

## Version 2.12.5
* Fixed NRE using KeyHints
* Fixed Mouse cursor not visible when blocking Input for UI

## Version 2.12.4

## Version 2.12.3
* Fixed an error with the console command for the upcoming 0.217 update (currently in PTB), still compatible with the stable Valheim release (0.216.9). Note that the PTB branch isn't supported and may cause unexpected issues at any time
* Fixed JotunnBuildTask compile issues for .NET 7.0

## Version 2.12.2
* Fixed an error when switching tabs with Q/E and no custom categories where added
* Fixed order of custom tabs with other mods that add custom categories

## Version 2.12.1

* Changed `PieceManager.PieceCategorySettings` to be obsolete as they are no longer used
* Changed `PieceManager.RemovePieceCategory` to no longer remove categories where a piece is still assigned to the category. This is to prevent problems with other mods that might still use this category 
* Changed Manager Init() methods to be private and not callable by mods. They were not intended to be called by mods and could cause issues
* Changed Mock resolve depth from 3 to 5, this should catch some edge cases where fields are nested deeper
* Changed empty CustomLocalization constructor to be marked obsolete, LocalizationManager.Instance.GetLocalization() should be used instead
* Fixed empty translation values where not allowed, thus a valid key can be translated to an empty string
* Fixed translations not being added to the Localization instance if it was already initialized
* Slightly improved loading time of big mod packs when creating custom entities (again)

## Version 2.11.7
* Added Valheim network version check to the disconnect window to better identify the cause of a disconnect. Only visible if both server and client are running Jotunn 2.11.7 or higher

* Fixed custom skills names were not being added to autocomplete in cheat commands

* Basic H&H compatibility. Looks like everything works but problems might still arise

* Mock references added via Config are resolved automatically, set FixReference = false if your actual GO does not use mocks
