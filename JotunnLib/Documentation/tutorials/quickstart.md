# Developer's Quickstart

Different developers prefer to reference their dependencies in different manners, for different use cases and situations. These are the basic steps to integrate Jötunn into a new or existing project.

## Install Jötunn via NuGet

If you just want to use the library and none of its automations all you need to do is to install the latest release of Jötunn from [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/JotunnLib) into your project and start using it. Jötunn uses `MMHooks` which are event subscription wrappers generated by [Monomod](https://github.com/MonoMod/MonoMod) for patching methods, and provide an intuitive interface for interacting with runtime detours. You can generate your own MMHook's by downloading [Hookgen](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ValheimModding/HookGenPatcher/), applying it to your BepInEx directory, and then launch the game to generate the assembly wrappers inside of `Valheim/BepInEx/Plugins/MMHook/` which can then be added as dependencies to your project.

Adding a Nuget in Visual Studio is pretty simple.

- Right click on your project, and select *Manage Nuget Packages* <br />![Vs Manage Nuget](../images/data/vs-Manage-Nuget.png)
- Click on *Browse* tab in the main pane, then type Jotunn to search for our nuget. Ensure that *Include Pre-Release* is unchecked.<br />![Vs Nuget Add Jotunn](../images/data/vs-NugetAddJotunn.png) and then select *Install* in the right hand pane.
- Jötunn should now be installed as a depenency for your project, and the `Jotunn` namespace should be resolved.

## Activate PreBuild automations

### Add project references

Jötunn can automatically reference and resolve all dependencies that may be needed for the development process. To use this feature browse to your solution directory. Create a new file called `Environment.props` and place the following contents inside, modifying your `<VALHEIM_INSTALL>` to point to your game directory. This sets up references in your project to BepInEx, the publicized dlls and MMHook dlls.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project ToolsVersion="Current" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <!-- Needs to be your path to the base Valheim folder -->
    <VALHEIM_INSTALL>X:\PathToYourSteamLibary\steamapps\common\Valheim</VALHEIM_INSTALL>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

**WARNING:** _If you already have references to BepInEx and Valheim, this task will most certainly duplicate them._

### Publicize and MMHook Valheim assemblies

Jötunn can automatically create the publicized and MMHook assemblies for you. To use this feature you must have the `Environment.props` file from the last step. Additionally you need to create a new file called `DoPrebuild.props` in your solution directory.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project ToolsVersion="Current" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <ExecutePrebuild>true</ExecutePrebuild>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

**WARNING:** _This prebuild task will automate the generation of monomod method detours and publicising of game assemblies. By enabling this, you understand that you will be generating new publicised assemblies and method detours upon PreBuild **IF** the binaries have been updated since the last time the PreBuild has run._

## First build dependency acquisition
Even if you have errors in your project, you should still build the solution and ensure that the PreBuild task has run and completed successfully. You can ensure it has run by deleting the MMHook directory inside of `Plugins` and watch it get regenerated as you build the solution.

After the PreBuild has run, and dependencies have been generated, they are automatically referenced via Jötunn. They are generated inside of your game directory, and will ensure that your mods are always built against the latest version of the game.

Done! You should now have all of your required dependencies resolved, such as BepInEx, Harmony, Monomod, Publicised assemblies, Unity corelibs, and Jotunn!

## BepInDependency

Don't forget to add dependency tags for bepin and compatibility! This will ensure your mod throws an error if installed without Jotunn. Click for more information about [NetworkCompatibilty](../tutorials/utils/NetworkCompatibility.md).
```cs
[BepInDependency(Jotunn.Main.ModGuid)]
[NetworkCompatibilty(CompatibilityLevel.EveryoneMustHaveMod, VersionStrictness.Minor)]
